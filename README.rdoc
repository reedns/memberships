This app utilizes a has_many :through relationship between a User and Group class. In order to create or join a group a User must sign up or sign in.  When a user creates a group they are automatically included as a group member.  A user can also join an existing group by clicking on the join group button in the group show page.  It connects the two resources via a create method in the user_associations controller.
